# Phase 4: Iterate and improve

Building a closed loop system is not easy, and it's not a one-and-done effort.
You will need to continue to watch and validate the outputs of your systems and
evaluate outcomes. You may need to continue to refine your setup, your
algorithms, etc. You may also want to improve your hardware setup and other
pieces of your system over time.

These efforts are certainly worthwhile and bring out the best in technological
creativity, but they also tend to distract in the early stages of development.

After you've closed the loop, are running consistently and successfully and
want to go to the next level, consider any of the following projects, in
addition to contributing back with improvements to algorithms and tools in
OpenAPS:

* Data visualization
* Smartphone integration
* On-board displays
* Hardware size reduction
* Hardware power consumption reduction
* Refined analytical modeling
* Integration with fitness trackers
