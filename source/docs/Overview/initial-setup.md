# Phase 0: General Setup

Phase 0 focuses on getting everything required for an OpenAPS implementation procured, installed, and ready for tinkering. This is primarily accomplished through following steps in the [Hardware](../walkthrough/phase-0/hardware.md) and [Setup](../walkthrough/phase-0/rpi.md) sections.  


* Upon Completion
    * Have collected some of your own baseline data to use for future analysis 
    * Have gone through the setup process and be able to help others do the same
    * Possess hardware and software tools necessary to build an OpenAPS implementation


* Phase Tasks
    * Store at least 30 days of CGM data and/or a recent A1c 
    * Procure hardware 
    * Download and install software and tools
    * Test a subset of tools to make sure they work as expected
    

* Community Contribution
    * Provide feedback on ...
        * Hardware procurement (cheap deals, alternatives)
        * Difficulties with installation process (‘this looked different on my system” or “I couldn’t locate that menu” or “I ran into this error”)
        * Solutions to overcome setup difficulties, especially for systems that are not yet covered (some different flavor of Linux, for example)
    * Help edit setup instructions for accuracy, coverage, ease of understanding
